\section{Introduction}
Digital logic and circuits are an essential part of understanding the hardware components of any electronic device. Hardware descriptive languages such as Verilog, introduce us to the process of designing a new computer circuit from scratch. In this section of the project, we will be incorporating various logical gates, shift circuits, and arithmetic operations to generate simulation waveforms. Some goals that we as a group share is to improve our understanding of the methodology of designing new computer circuits from scratch. We also wish to familiarize ourselves with the Verilog programming language, which is new to us. 

\section{Verilog Code}
\label{sec:headings}

In this final step of the project, we will be implementing every ALU module from part 2 and creating a control circuit. These modules include logical AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, NOT, 4-bit input, 4-bit shift register, and various arithmetic operation circuits. We will bring all of these modules together to form a control circuit for the ALU. Below will be a description of each module.





\section{And Circuit}
The And circuit takes two inputs, A and B, with an output X. In order for the output of this gate to be 1, both inputs must also be 1. This logic gate works well with operations that require all conditions to be met simultaneously.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/and_gate_tb.v}

To test the And circuit, we have created two registers, A and B, as well as a wire X. This way we can take two inputs at a time and test each possible input for the circuit. If it's working correctly, X should be equal to 1 for all inputs only when both A and B are equal to 1.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/and_gate.v}

    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Waveform Tests}

The last section we will showcase the waveforms created using our testbenches for each circuit we coded in Verilog. We used GTKWave to create these waveforms.

\section{Nand Circuit}
The Nand circuit, similarly to the And circuit, takes two inputs- A and B, with an output X. This output will only shoot back a 1 assuming that both A and B are not equal to 1, hence the Nand (Not and) logic gate.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/nand_gate_tb.v}

To test the Nand circuit, we have created two registers, A and B, as well as a wire X. This way we are able to take two inputs at a time and test each possible input for the circuit. If it's working correctly, X should be equal to 1 for all inputs except when both A and B are equal to 1. This gate is often used in circuits as a building block as it can be combined to create other logic gates.

The last section we will showcase the waveforms created using our testbenches for each circuit we coded in Verilog. We used GTKWave to create these waveforms.





\section{Or Circuit}
The Or circuit takes two inputs, A and B, with an output X. This output will only shoot back a 1 assuming that either A, B. or both are equal to 1. If both a and b are 0, the output will also be 0. This gate is often used in circuits were an output is required when at least one condition is true.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/or_gate_tb.v}

To test the Or circuit, we have created two registers, A and B, as well as a wire X. This way we are able to take two inputs at a time and test each possible input for the circuit. If it's working correctly, X should be equal to 1 whenever a or b (or both) are equal to 1.

\section{Nor Circuit}
The Nor circuit takes two inputs, A and B, with an output X. This output will only shoot back a 1 assuming that both A and B are equal to 0, hence the Nor logic gate. For the output to return a high value, both inputs need to be low. This gate is often used in circuits where the output is true when all inputs are false.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/nor_gate_tb.v}

To test the Nor circuit, we have created two registers, A and B, as well as a wire X. This way we are able to take two inputs at a time and test each possible input for the circuit. If it's working correctly, X should be equal to 1 for all inputs except when both A and B are equal to 0.

\section{Xor Circuit}
The Xor circuit takes two inputs, A and B, with an output X. This output will only shoot back a 1 assuming that only one of the inputs is 1. if A and B are different (A = 1, B = 0), then the output will be 1. 
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/xor_gate_tb.v}

To test the Xor circuit, we have created two registers, A and B, as well as a wire X. This way we are able to take two inputs at a time and test each possible input for the circuit. If it's working correctly, X should be equal to 1 only when one of the inputs is equal to 1. This gate is often used in circuits that require distinguishing between inputs.

\section{Xnor Circuit}
The Xnor circuit takes two inputs, A and B, with an output X. This output will only shoot back a 1 assuming that both A and B are the same value (A = 1, B = 1 || A = 0, B = 0). If the value for A is different from that of B, then the output will be 0.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/xnor_gate_tb.v}

To test the Xnor circuit, we have created two registers, A and B, as well as a wire X. This way we can take two inputs at a time and test each possible input for the circuit. If it's working correctly, X should be equal to 1 only when A and B have the same value. This gate is used in circuits where we need the output to be true when both inputs match.

The Not circuit takes two inputs: A and B.The Not gate will revert the value inputted. If the value of A is 1, then the value of B will be 0 and vice versa.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/not_gate_tb.v}

To test the Not circuit, we have created two registers, A and B. This way we can take two inputs at a time and test each possible input for the circuit. If it's working correctly, A should be equal to 1 whenever B is equal to 0.

\section{2x4-bit input Circuit}
The 4 bit input circuit takes two inputs, fourin and fourout. We create a shift input. 
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/four_bit_input_tb.v}
To test this 4 bit circuit, we create a register that takes in a 4 bit value. This value works alongside the clock which when executed using the @posedge and the clock signal goes from high to low, the input will be transfered into the output.

\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/four_bit_input.v}



\subsection{Waveform Tests}

The last section we will showcase the waveforms created using our testbenches for each circuit we coded in Verilog. We used GTKWave to create these waveforms.






\section{2x4-bit output Shift Circuit}
The 4 bit input circuit takes two inputs, datain and dataout. We use a clock/ reset and create a shift input in order to determine the shift direction (high = 1 = right, low = 0 = left).  On the rising edge of the reset, we set the output to 4'b0000 (0 in verilog) which clears the shift register. While this process is happening, if the shift is high, the data is shifted right by 1 bit and when the shift is low, the data is shifted left by 1 bit.

\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/four_bit_shift_circuit_tb.v}

To test the 4bit shift circuit, we have created two registers, A and B, as well as a wire X. We also create a.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/four_bit_shift_circuit.v}



\subsection{Waveform Tests}

The last section we will showcase the waveforms created using our testbenches for each circuit we coded in Verilog. We used GTKWave to create these waveforms.










\section{Addition}
The addition module takes in two inputs - A and B - which are both 4-bit. These represent the numbers that will be added. We then create the sum output which is the 4-bit result of the addition. the carry in is a single bit representing any carry coming in from previous calculations. Due to us adding 4-bit values, we create a 5 bit wire called addition result which accounts for any overflow we may encounter. 
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/addition_tb.v}

To test the addition of the 4-bit values, we assign the sum of A and B and the carry in to our 5 bit variable. Once assigned, the 5-bit wire stores the 4 least significant bits and stores them into our sum output. We finally assign the overflow bit to the carry out.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/addition.v}







\subsection{Waveform Tests}

The last section we will showcase the waveforms created using our testbenches for each circuit we coded in Verilog. We used GTKWave to create these waveforms.






\section{Subtraction}
The subtraction module takes in two inputs - A and B - which are both 4-bit. These represent the numbers that will be added. We then create the difference output which is the 4-bit result of the subtraction. the carry in is a single bit that acts as a borrow input in our calculations. Due to us subtracting 4-bit values, we create a 5 bit wire called subtraction result which accounts for any overflow we may encounter. 
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/subtraction_tb.v}

To test the subtraction of the 4-bit values, we assign the difference of A and B and the carry in to our 5 bit variable. Once assigned, the 5-bit wire stores the 4 least significant bits which the difference output later recieves. The carry out will hold the borrow bit only if A < B.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/subtraction.v}




\subsection{Waveform Tests}

The last section we will showcase the waveforms created using our testbenches for each circuit we coded in Verilog. We used GTKWave to create these waveforms










\section{Multiplication}
The multiplication module takes in two 4-bit inputs - A and B. The inputs represent the numbers that will be multiplied. We also create an output called product in order to store the value of the multiplication.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/multiplication_tb.v}

In order to multiply the two 4-bit values, we have to ensure that our product can handle any overflow. We can achieve this by making the product an 8-bit value. This is because the multiplication of two 4-bit values may produce up to an 8-bit value. We then simply assign the multiplication of A and B to the product variable.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/multiplication.v}





\subsection{Waveform Tests}

The last section we will showcase the waveforms created using our testbenches for each circuit we coded in Verilog. We used GTKWave to create these waveforms.







\section{Division}
The division module takes in two 4-bit inputs - A and B. The inputs represent the numbers that will be divided. We also create two 4-bit outputs which are the quotient and remainder. These will be used to store their respective values.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/division_tb.v}

In order to divide the two 4-bit values, we simply assign the division of A and B to the quotient variable. We then use modulo in order to determine if there is a remainder and then assign the value to its corresponding output. We also use the modulo as a check to see if b is equal to 0. We do this in order to ensure that we aren't dividing A by 0.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/division.v}




\section{Control Circuit}
The control circuit module was created with the purpose to perform various arithmetic and logical operations on two operands. We introduce 2 new variables: operation type which is our 4-bit input responsible for representing the type of operation the ALU will perform and controller which is our output responsible for signaling the ALU to perform a specific operation. We chose to make the operation type 4-bit because we want it to represent values ranging from 0 - 15. This is the case because we will be assigning binary values to each operation type. The always@(*) is a combinational logic block which is evaluated every time the values of the operation type input change. Inside this block we utilize a case statement in order to check the values operation type and to help us assign the value of the controller to fit the input. 

We assign each ALU module with a binary value. 4'b0000 for the AND, 4'b0001 for the NAND, 4'b0010 for the OR, 4'b0011 for the NOR, 4'b0100 for the XOR, 4'b0101 for the XNOR, 4'b0110 for the NOT, 4'b0111 for the addition, 4'b1000 for the subtraction, 4'b1001 for the multiplication, 4'b 1010 for the division. Once we have these values, we are able to direct the controller to the correct module when controlling. The controller signals are the control inputs that direct the ALU to execute the chosen operation.


\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Verilog/ControlCircuit.v}
\newpage 
Similar to previous test benches, we begin by creating some variables which are important for specific modules. These include a clock, reset, carry in, inputs, and our controller. We instantiate the control circuit which connects the inputs and the outputs which are the operation type and controller respectively. The use of the clock is important as it is used to synchronize the behavior of the control circuit. We initialize our operation type to the default (AND). The testing portion of the code consists of several test cases where the operation type is changed similar to before, but the a and b values are specified. These tests allow for us to check whether the control circuit generates the correct outputs for various modules. Using the previous 4-bit binary values stated, we assign values to a and b that will prove that the operation type is the correct one. For example, we set the operation type to 4'b0000, which we know corresponds to the AND gate. We set the operands (a and b) equal to an arbitrary value that we will keep consistent throughout the tests. The expected behavior of the AND operation is that a AND b results in 4'b0000. In order to make the waveforms more readable, we use a delay of 5 time units. This same process is repeated for different operations, each time setting the operation type to the corresponding binary value and using the values of a and b.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we successfully created and tested various circuits using Verilog and GTKWave. Learning how to code in Verilog, at least for our purposes, was relatively simple with few difficulties. Using GTKWave was also fairly intuitive. The most difficulty our group has had so far was most likely creating this report in LaTeX, as we have some trouble with coding certain formatting as well as issues with figures floating around the document. Creating these logic circuits from scratch allowed us to work on the basic logic gates (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR) that are so critical to all electronics. This final portion of this project has been the culmination of everything we have learned throughout this project. We learned how to create a control circuit in order to test and measure every single module we have written. The use of Verilog and GTKWave works as a stepping stone to furthering our engineering careers and building on our knowledge of both the software and hardware components of electronics.
